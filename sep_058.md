Abstract
-----------

Genetic parts often have more than one identifier, either for historical reasons or because there are "nickname" versions of an identifier. This SEP proposes a means of tracking the relationship between the canonical name for a part (or other object) and a set of aliases that can be used to redirect to it from other identities.

1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>
----------------

Genetic parts often have more than one identifier. Sometimes this is due to "nickname" conventions, e.g., the iGEM part "J23101" is a short form of the less-frequently used "BBa_J23101".  Other times, a part may have had one identifier historically, but later been renamed to another identifier. Similar things may also happen with objects other than genetic parts.

Currently, these types of relationships in SBOL are handled via ad hoc tables or special-case code. In other systems of identifiers, however, there is generally some sort of system for linking from alternative identities to a canonical entity (e.g., "aliases", "links", "redirects", "forwarding"). Just as in other systems, adding an alias capability to SBOL will allow tools to more consistently work with objects that have multiple identifiers or that change identifier over time.


2. Specification <a name="specification"></a>
----------------------------------------------

The specification will be modified by adding an `Alias` class to the specification between `TopLevel` and `Sequence` and by allowing any reference to a `TopLevel` to also refer to an `Alias`.

### Alias

An `Alias` is a `TopLevel` object that is used to redirect references to an identity to another, preferred identity. 

An `Alias` MAY be used in place of any other `TopLevel` object, but SHOULD NOT be if the preferred identity is known. As such, whenever a reference to a `TopLevel` object is discovered to be an `Alias` object, that reference SHOULD be updated to the value of the `referent` property of the `Alias`.

#### The referent property

An `Alias` object MUST have precisely one `referent` property, which contains the `URI` for a `TopLevel` object to which references to the `Alias` are intended to be redirected.

Any chain of `Alias` object `referent` property values MUST NOT be circular, i.e., following `referent` values MUST ultimately lead to a `TopLevel` that is not an `Alias`. 

The `referent` SHOULD point to the most persistent and canonical identity available for the object to which it refers. Complementarily, this implies that the `referent` SHOULD NOT itself be an `Alias`. 

A `referent` that is an `Alias` MAY occur in some circumstances, e.g., in the case where the `referent` of an `Alias` has its identity changed, leaving behind a forwarding `Alias`, but as soon as this is discovered the `referent` value SHOULD be updated (just like any other `TopLevel` reference to an `Alias`).


### Modified Validation Rules

sbol3-10112: Each property of type IRI that is listed with a non-`TopLevel` reference type in Table 23 (i.e., child objects) MUST refer to an object of the type listed. 

sbol3-10113: Each property of type IRI that is listed with a `TopLevel` reference type in Table 23 MUST refer to either an object of the type listed or an object of type `Alias` with a referent that resolves to an object of the type listed.

Table 22 will include a new row:

Class | Parent | SBOL properties | Reference
------|--------|-----------------|------------
Alias | TopLevel | referent      | (Alias section)

Table 23 will include a new row:

Class | Property | Cardinality | Type | Referred Type | Reference
------|----------|-------------|------|------|-----
Alias | referent | EXACTLY ONE | IRI  | TopLevel    | (Alias section)


### New Validation Rules for the Alias Class

(weak REQUIRED) sbol3-10401: An `Alias` object MUST NOT form a cyclical chain of references via its `referent` property and those of other `Alias` objects. 
Reference: (Alias section)

(RECOMMENDED) sbol3-10402: The `referent` property of an `Alias` SHOULD NOT be the IRI for an object of type `Alias`.
Reference: (Alias section)

3. Example or Use Case <a name='example'></a>
-------------------------------

### Example: Multiple identities

iGEM promoter BBA_J23101 is best accessed as a `Component` from SynBioHub with identity `https://synbiohub.org/public/igem/BBa_J23101`.
It can also be referred to on `parts.igem.org` as either `J23101` or `BBa_J23101`, so two `Alias` objects are created:

* `Alias` identity `http://parts.igem.org/J23101` has a `referent` of `https://synbiohub.org/public/igem/BBa_J23101`

* `Alias` identity `http://parts.igem.org/BBa_J23101` has a `referent` of `https://synbiohub.org/public/igem/BBa_J23101`

### Example: Removing duplicates

In the 2022 iGEM distribution, software limitations meant that many copies of the plasmid pSB1C5 were created: `https://github.com/iGEM-Engineering/iGEM-distribution/Anderson%20Promoters/pSB1C5`, `https://github.com/iGEM-Engineering/iGEM-distribution/Fluorescent%20Reporter%20Proteins/pSB1C5`, `https://github.com/iGEM-Engineering/iGEM-distribution/RBS%20Collection/pSB1C5`, etc.

A vectors package is created with a canonical copy of pSB1C5 with identity `https://github.com/iGEM-Vectors/pSB1C5`. Each of the duplicates can then be replaced by an `Alias` with the same identity and a `referent` of `https://github.com/iGEM-Vectors/pSB1C5`

Note that tools using one of the 2022 packages will no longer have a copy of pSB1C5 locally in the package document. Thus, if the tool needs to access information about pSB1C5, it will need to locate and download a copy of the ``https://github.com/iGEM-Vectors/pSB1C5`` as indicated by the `referent`.

### Example: Change of identity in a dependency

Consider a `Component` for a composite part `http://myparts.org/MyProject` that uses pSB1C5 as a plasmid backbone, refering to this via its child object `http://myparts.org/MyProject/SubComponent1`. Specifically, the `instanceOf` property of `SubComponent1` points to one of the copies of pSB1C5 in the iGEM 2022 distribution: `https://github.com/iGEM-Engineering/iGEM-distribution/Anderson%20Promoters/pSB1C5`.

A tool working with `http://myparts.org/MyProject` needs to retrieve information about pSB1C5 and retrieves `https://github.com/iGEM-Engineering/iGEM-distribution/Anderson%20Promoters/pSB1C5` from the iGEM 2022 distribution. At this point, the tool discovers that it has retrieved an `Alias` with a `referent` of `https://github.com/iGEM-Vectors/pSB1C5`, and retrieves that object, obtaining pSB1C5 under its new identity from its new location.

The tool then suggests an update of the `instanceOf` property of `SubComponent1` from `https://github.com/iGEM-Engineering/iGEM-distribution/Anderson%20Promoters/pSB1C5` to `https://github.com/iGEM-Vectors/pSB1C5`, so that it once again points to a `Component` rather than an `Alias`.



4. Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>
-----------------

Aliases are purely an addition to the data model, so all previously valid SBOL3 documents will remain valid after the adoption of aliases. 

If a document makes use of aliases, however, it will pose problems for SBOL 3.1 tools that are not alias-aware:

* Alias objects will be judged invalid SBOL 3.1, since they contain objects with a previously unknown type in the SBOL namespace
* Objects that reference an alias will be judged invalid SBOL 3.1, because they point to an alias instead of an object of the expected type.
* Tools will behave erroneously when encountering an alias where they expect the object that the alias is standing in for.

For these reasons, in to make aliases work, it will be important to have a "resolve aliases" utility that:

1. replaces references to aliases with references to the alias' referent, and 
2. optionally removes all aliases from the document.

5. Discussion <a name='discussion'></a>
-----------------

The proposed means of representing aliases is only one of a number of possible alternatives. Here are other alternatives that were considered, and their advantages and disadvantages.

### Alternative: Raw Triple

Rather than creating an object for an alias, it would be possible to represent an alias with a single triple, e.g., `Alias isAliasOf Referent`

While this would be more compact, it would depart from the object model that is used for all other SBOL representations. Moreover, it would not allow commentary or provenance information to be added to aliases.

### Alternative: Alias object has two properties: referent and referred

In this approach, the reference stays the same, but we add a "backward-pointing" link that has cardinality `[1..n]`. Under this approach, you need to have a collection of aliases to query, and when looking up a TopLevel, if you do not find the TopLevel, then query the collection of aliases, to see if there is a `referred` property with that URI, which is then redirected to the `referent` to look up.

This approach has a validation problem, because you can put the same object in the `referred` field of multiple different Alias objects, with different `referent` value. If you have those Alias object in the same document, then you could detect this as a validation error, but this means that you could have conflicting redirects that are not detectable (i.e., database 1 says J23101 should be retrieved from SynBioHub, while database 2 says J23101 is a totally different sequence in NCBI.


### Alternative: Alias property on TopLevel

Rather than making an alias a separate object, it could instead be represented as a new `hasAlias` property on `TopLevel`.
This would also be compact, and in this case, the alias would remain bundled with the TopLevel that it references, e.g., `Referent hasAlias Alias`. 

With this structure, however, an alias cannot be looked up unless one already knows the referent. This defeats one of the key purposes of aliases, allowing forwarding of references.

One variation of how this could be used is in fact to have the alias object be of the same type as its referent, e.g., J23101 is a Component of type DNA with referent BBa\_J23101. This has the problem that J23101 is then a fork of BBa\_J23101, and can contain conflicting information.

### Alternative: Aliases for child objects

Aliases might also be used for child objects. For all cases besides `ComponentReference`, however, references to child objects happen only within their containing `TopLevel` object. Moreover, with `ComponentReference` a `refersTo` property outside of the containing `TopLevel` is always coupled with the other `TopLevel` vis the `inChildOf` property.

Thus, any redirection that would be needed for a child object can always be obtained via the corresponding redirect to its containing `TopLevel`.
