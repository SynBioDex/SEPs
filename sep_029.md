## Abstract

[SEP 001](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SEPs/issues/1) defined the procedure for managing SEPs.  This procedure currently mandates that all SEPs remain "open" on the issue tracker so that they are all visible by default. This SEP proposes that this requirement is changed so that SEPs issues can be closed when action is no longer required. This SEP also clarifies that the definitive text for an SEP is in the repository and not the issue tracker, solving the problem of unnecessary copy and pasting between the two.

## Motivation

It is generally accepted (citation needed) when using GitHub for software development that an open issue is something that requires attention, and when attention is no longer required, the issue can be closed.  As we are repurposing the GitHub issue tracker for keeping track of SEPs, it would therefore be logical that the issues SEPs that no longer require editorial attention (e.g. revoked, or merged into spec) can be closed.

Moreover, in the current system, the text of SEPs is duplicated; it is usually copied once for the markdown file contained in the repository itself, and once for the issue.  In this SEP we recommend that the text of SEPs exist only in the repository.  SEPs can then remain permanently in the repository for posterity, while their issues can eventually be closed by the editors.

Finally, the assertion that the issue number corresponds with the SEP number is removed, as this has not been the case in practice.


## Specification 

The following text of SEP 001 under "2.5 Decision":

> All SEPs will always remain "Open" on the issue tracker so that they are all visible by default. Editors attach and update issue labels to allow easy filtering for SEP Type and Status.

Is superceded by the following:

> SEPs remain "Open" on the issue tracker until they no longer require attention; i.e., have been either accepted and merged into the specification, rejected, or revoked.

The following text under "2.2 SEP Submission":

> If approved, an editor will submit the SEP to the dedicated github issue tracker, for which only SBOL editors have write-access.  The github issue number then becomes the SEP number by which the proposal can be referenced.

Is superceded by the following:

> If approved, an editor will merge the pull request for the SEP into the dedicated SEPs repository on github, for which only SBOL editors have write-access.
