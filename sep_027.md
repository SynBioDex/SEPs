## Abstract

In SBOL2, ComponentDefinitions can have multiple Sequences, and ComponentDefinitions can also have SequenceAnnotations.  Currently, it is ambiguous which Sequence the SequenceAnnotation(s) refer to. Adding a link from Location to the Sequence it is annotating would solve this.


## Motivation

As abstract



## Specification 

Add a `sequence` property to Location that links to a Sequence.



## Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>

When loading older SBOL:

* If there is exactly one sequence in a ComponentDefinition, make locations in the SequenceAnnotations of that ComponentDefinition point to that sequence
* If more than one sequence, warn that the annotations are ambiguous

Backporting to older SBOL:

* If exactly one sequence in a ComponentDefinition, remove the sequence property of locations in the SequenceAnnotations of that ComponentDefinition
* If more than one sequence, cannot be represented in older SBOL, throw an error.
