Abstract
-----------

In SBOL 2.2.1, the type of a provenance `Activity` must be inferred via the `roles` properties of its associated `Usage` objects. This solution does not enable to explicitly specify the type of an `Activity`, making it hard to reason or communicate the type of the `Activity` that transforms `Usage` objects into `wasGeneratedBys` `Identified` objects.

## 1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>
----------------

SBOL 2.3.0 should enable the explicit specification of the type of a provenance `Activity`. Previously, SBOL 2.2.1 introduced ontology terms for classification of `Activities` into the following categories: "design", "build", "test", and "learn". However, this approach is rather indirect in its implementation. The type of an `Activity` must be inferred indirectly by interpreting terms placed on `Usage` and `Association` utility classes. We propose to explicitly label an `Activity` with a `types` field. This approach has advantages for future representation of a broader set of `Activities`, as well as matching how SBOL developers actually describe and think about `Activities` in practice. In the future, we imagine that ontology-based implementations of SBOL will become more common, and a rich ontology of `Activities` that include subtypes of "design", "build", "test", and "learn" should become available to users. In the near-term, adopting this approach will also make searching for `Activities` easier as well. For example, a lab user will be able to easily query the "build" history of a construct without concern for other types of provenance outside their area of expertise, such as modeling.

## 2. Specification <a name="specification"></a>
----------------------------------------------

We propose to add the field `types` to the `Activity` class. If the type of the `Activity` is specified, then the type must refer to a URI, which is ideally an ontology term.

```
class Activity:
    types [0..*] : URI
```

Users may define their own `types` terms though the recommended terms , in accordance with SEP 19, are as follows:
* `http://sbols.org/v2#design` describes a process by which a conceptual representation of an engineer's imagined and intended design is derived, possibly from a model or pre-existing design.
* `http://sbols.org/v2#build` describes a process by which a sample is derived in accordance with a conceptual design, often from other samples.
* `http://sbols.org/v2#test` describes a process by which raw data or observations are derived via experimental measurement of samples.
* `http://sbols.org/v2#learn` describes a process by which a theoretical model, analysis, datasheet, etc. is derived, usually from experimental data or another model.

### Validation Rules

* If an `Activity` has a `types` value of `http://sbols.org/v2#design` and also contains an `Association`, then that `Association` MUST have a `roles` value of `http://sbols.org/v2#design` 
* If an `Activity` has a `types` value of `http://sbols.org/v2#build` and also contains an `Association`, then that `Association` MUST have a `roles` value of `http://sbols.org/v2#build` 
* If an `Activity` has a `types` value of `http://sbols.org/v2#test` and also contains an `Association`, then that `Association` MUST have a `roles` value of `http://sbols.org/v2#test` 
* If an `Activity` has a `types` value of `http://sbols.org/v2#learn` and also contains an `Association`, then that `Association` MUST have a `roles` value of `http://sbols.org/v2#learn` 

## 3. Example or Use Case <a name='example'></a>
-------------------------------

In SBOL 2.2.1, a design-to-build transition of a ComponentDefinition is done as follows:
```
ComponentDefinition:
    id: CD
    type: CDS

Activity:
    id: Build_Activity
    qualifiedUsages:
        Usage: 
            entity: CD
            roles: http://sbols.org/v2#build 

Implementation:
    id: Impl
    built: CD
    wasGeneratedBy: Build_Activity
```

According to SBOL 2.2.1, in this example
* it is not explicitly stated that the `Build_Activity` represents the actual build process of the designed `CD` component.
* the `Build_Activity` is optional

Our proposed solution would look like as follows in SBOL 2.3.0, in order to encode the design-to-build transition:
```
ComponentDefinition:
    id: CD
    type: CDS

Activity:
    id: Build_Activity
    type: http://sbols.org/v2#build
    qualifiedUsages:
        Usage: 
            entity: CD
            role: http://sbols.org/v2#design 

Implementation:
    id: Impl
    built: CD
    wasGeneratedBy: Build_Activity
```

In this example, we now 
* explicity specify that the `Build_Activity` activity is of type `http://sbols.org/v2#build`, which is a term defined in the SBOL specification.
* specify that the `CD` is the designed component (`role: http://sbols.org/v2#design`) that is being transformed into an `Implementation` by the `Build_Activity` activity
* keep the specification of the `Build_Activity` still optional

## 4. Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>
-----------------

Since the proposed `type` field is optional (`[0..*]`), there are no issues regarding backwards compatibility.

## 5. Discussion <a name='discussion'></a>
-----------------

## 6. Competing SEPs <a name='competing_seps'></a>
-----------------

There are no competing SEPs.

A possible criticism with this approach is that it introduces redundant terms on `Association:roles` and `Activity:types`. However, `Associations` are not a required class which can lead to ambiguous cases when the `Association` is not specified. Specifying an `Activity:types` can resolve these ambiguities. Furthermore, this specification intends to be an intermediate stage of development that will lead to a rich ontology of `Activity:types`, `Usage:roles`, and `Association:roles`.
