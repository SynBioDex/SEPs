Abstract
-----------

The number of classes in the SBOL data model grew sharply with the introduction of SBOL 2.0.  Prior to generalizations such as turning DnaComponent into ComponentDefinition, many discussions took place about the nonmenclature, and eventually a quorum was reached and the class names were accepted. 

SBOL2 has been released for some time now, and the community is now familiar with using the data model in practice.  This SEP suggests that, given our experience actually using SBOL2, we reconsider the nonmenclature once more for SBOL3.0.  The intention would be to simplify names and to convey meaning more effectively.


1. Motivation
----------------

SBOL2 can be very confusing to newcomers, and the verbosity of its class names doesn't help.  The most common class in SBOL is likely `ComponentDefinition`, which is a verbose name usually abbreviated to "CD" or simply "component". Confusingly though, SBOL 2.x also defines a class `Component` which, however, actually describes a subcomponent. Similar issues exist with `ModuleDefinition` and `Module`. 

The rationale for this SEP, using Component as an example, are that:

* In SBOL2, `Component` _must_ be contained by a `ComponentDefinition` and is therefore _always_ a subcomponent.  Changing the name to `SubComponent` is <b>more expressive</b>.

* This change leaves the name `Component` free for `ComponentDefinition` to be renamed to.  Removing "Definition" makes the name <b>less verbose</b> and <b>less confusing</b>. The simplified name `Component` matches what programmers currently use in colloqial conversations about SBOL.

* In programming languages, classes are definitions _implicitly_ and do not need to be explicitly named as such.  For example, the `File` class in Java is called `File`, not `FileDefinition`, even before an instance of it has been created.  Bringing SBOL in line with this makes SBOL <b>more intuitive</b>.

The `FunctionalComponent` class, though also confusingly named, will remain as-is for the purposes of this SEP.



2. Specification 
----------------------------------------------

The following classes will be renamed:

* `ComponentDefinition` to `Component`
* `Component` to `SubComponent`
* `ModuleDefinition` to `Module`
* `Module` to `SubModule`


3. Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>
-----------------

This is a major change, but only to the names of classes. (Note: a separate SEP will deal with removing FunctionalComponent).  Consequently, updating the libraries should be straightforward.  It is important to defer this change to SBOL 3.0 so that the namespace is different (otherwise, it would be ambiguous whether a Component was an SBOL 2.0 Component instance or a SBOL 3.0 Component).

More generally, tools solely programmed for SBOL 2.x will, in any case, run into trouble when opening an SBOL 3.0 document. SBOL2 documents use the URI prefix `http://sbols.org/v2#` for terms.  Presumably, SBOL3 will use the `http://sbols.org/v3#` prefix, which will prevent SBOL2 and SBOL3 from clashing.



4. Discussion <a name='discussion'></a>
-----------------

### 5.1 Related SEPs

The following SEPs make complementary suggestions for further simplification of the SBOL data model:

* SEP 10 -- a proposal to separate sequence feature annotations from sub-component (part) compositions

* SEP 1x -- removing FunctionalComponent

### 5.2 Implementation cost

Library developers may be concerned at the time cost of implementing such a significant change.  However, as the proposed change is only to the nonmenclature and not the semantics, it should generally be no less complicated than a find/replace operation.

### 5.2 Distinction between SBOL 2.x and 3.x documents

SBOL2 documents use the URI prefix `http://sbols.org/v2#` for terms.  Presumably, SBOL3 will use the `http://sbols.org/v3#` prefix, which will prevent SBOL2 and SBOL3 from clashing.  This has yet to be discussed.
