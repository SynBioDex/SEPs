Abstract
-----------

SBOL currently is missing any clear means to distinguish between circular
(e.g. plasmid) and linear DNA constructs. Also double- and single-stranded DNA or RNA is not distinguished. This proposal describes a best-practice and new validation rules for encoding topology and strand information in the ComponentDefinition.type field.


1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>
----------------

Engineered DNA constructs are currently mostly deposited, used and exchanged as
circular, double-stranded, plasmid DNA. However, there are also many
applications for linear constructs which are easily and cheaply accessible
through PCR or gene synthesis. Moreover, even circular plasmid DNA may be cut
and stored or exchanged as linear DNA to aid the construction of new
vectors. Likewise, natural or engineered genomes may be circular (bacterial
chromosomes) or linear (eukaryotic chromosomes). Both linear and circular DNA or
RNA molecules can, moreover, be either double-stranded (ds) or single
stranded. RNA, typically, is used as single-stranded molecule whereas DNA is,
mostly, utilized double-stranded (dsDNA). However, oligonucleotides (primers)
are an example of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) which, however, can also be
complemented into double-stranded fragments.

Knowing whether a given construct is supposed to have circular or linear
topology is of relevance both for experimental design and for basic sequence
analysis. Nevertheless, unlike the much older genbank format, SBOL so far lacks
the possibility to distinguish between linear and circular DNA. Likewise, the
distinction between single-stranded and double-stranded has important
consequences but is not currently conveyed by SBOL.


2. Specification <a name="specification"></a>
----------------------------------------------

(2.1) Topology

Any ComponentDefinition classified as *DNA* (via its `type` field) is
RECOMMENDED to encode circular/linear topology information in an additional
`type` field. This (topology) `type` field MUST point to either of two possible
Sequence Ontology terms:

  * SO:0000987 -- a.k.a. 'linear' [http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0000987]
  * SO:0000988 -- a.k.a. 'circular' [http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0000988]

There is no default topology for DNA. Lack of topology information is only
acceptable for DNA records without or with incomplete sequence information. Lack
of topology information is **not** acceptable for DNA `ComponentDefinition`
records with fully specified sequence -- unless the topology is genuinely
unknown, in which case the sequence is, in fact, not fully specified.

The topology `type` field is OPTIONAL for RNA `ComponentDefinition` records. The
default assumption for RNA records is linear topology.

Any other `ComponentDefinition` record (protein, small molecule, etc) MUST NOT
have a `type` field with DNA topology information.

(2.2) Topology Validation Rules

If `ComponentDefinition` has type 'DNA' and has a `sequence` record but does not have a `type` field pointing to either 'linear' or 'circular' (SO:0000987 or 988), this should trigger a *warning*.

If `ComponentDefinition` has any type *other* than 'DNA' or 'RNA' and has a `type` field pointing to SO:0000987 or 988, this MUST be considered an *error*.

(2.3) Double / Single stranded

Any `ComponentDefinition` classified as *DNA* or *RNA* (via its `type` field)
MAY have strand information encoded in an additional `type` field pointing to
either of two possible Sequence Ontology terms:

  * SO:0000984 -- a.k.a. 'single' [http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0000984]
  * SO:0000985 -- a.k.a. 'double' [http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0000985]

In absence of this field, the default strand information assumed for DNA is
'double-stranded' and for RNA is 'single-stranded'. 

Any other `ComponentDefinition` record (protein, small molecule, etc) MUST NOT
have any `type` field pointing to these SO terms.

(2.4) Strand validation rules

If `ComponentDefinition` has any type *other* than 'DNA' or 'RNA' and has a `type` field pointing to SO:0000984 or 985, this MUST be considered an *error*.


(2.5) Consequences for software tools

`circular` topology (SO:0000988) instructs software to interpret the beginning
/ end position of a given sequence (be it DNA or RNA) as arbitrary so that sequence 
features may be mapped or identified across this junction.

`double` stranded (SO:0000985) instructs software to apply sequence searches to
both strands (i.e. sequence and reverse complement of sequence).


3. Example or Use Case <a name='example'></a>
-------------------------------

This is such a basic feature of molecular biology that it is difficult to find
an example where it is, in fact, *not* needed. By way of example, consider
popular sequence design software such as Benchling, CLC, VectorNTI or others. In
these cases, declaring a sequence as circular changes the view and the searching
behaviour of the sequence editor.

Example for double-stranded / single-stranded:

  While the pattern 'ATG' is not found within the sequence `TTCCTAC`, the reverse complement of this sequence does contain `ATG`. Whether or not a given sequence is considered double-stranded therefore decides whether or not it matches a given pattern.

Example for circular / linear:

  While no 'ATG' start codon is found within the linear sequence `GAATCATCATAT`, this sequence does contain a start codon if considered circular. 


4. Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>
-----------------

No backwards compatibility issues are foreseen. However, the fields
will be missing from older records. Software then should fall
back to making an educated guess or assuming linear topology.


5. Discussion <a name='discussion'></a>
-----------------

### 5.1 creating new fields `topology` and `strand`

This was, in fact, the original suggestion. It was retracted in order to make topology and strand information already available in SBOL 2.2. Depending on experience, this issue may be re-visited before finalizing SBOL 3.0.

Declaration of dedicated fields for this information would have advantages:  
  * more explicit (rather than several `type` fields pointing to cryptic SO terms, the attribute name would clarify what type of information can be expected)
  * lower risk that topology and strand information is omitted
  * less or less complex validation rules
  * software would not have to interpret a collection of type fields even though it is only interested in, for example, telling apart circular plasmid DNA from DNA fragments
  *  if non-standard SO terms are used, software could, at least, still know whether the unknown term refers to `topology`, `strand` or `type`

Disadvantage:

  * the two fields would only apply to 'RNA' and 'DNA' ComponentDefinition, validation rules would still be needed.
  * This may be more confusing for software developers than extra type fields.


### 5.2 optional versus required fields

I originally proposed to make fields required at the data model level. However, since topology and strand information makes little or even no sense for ComponentDefinitions describing proteins or small molecules, this was dropped (following debate on sbol-dev). As pointined out at COMBINE, CompentDefinition without sequence information cannot be required to have topology information neither. Moreover, topology information may genuinely unknown. For all these reasons, the field cannot be required. It is recommended as best practice.


### 5.3 boolean value instead of SO term

The original SEP proposed boolean values (circular=True/False). This was critized on the grounds that we, so far, are not using boolean values anywhere in SBOL and that we should tie things in with SO instead.

### 5.4 Combine `topology` and `strand` into one field

SO offers terms for all 8 combinations of circular/linear and double/single stranded and DNA/RNA. An example is
the term `circular_double_stranded_DNA_chromosome`. Using these terms was considered less elegant. (1) software likely would have to decompose these terms again, (2) the 'chromosome' semantics does not fit many SBOL applications.

### 5.5 Formulation through sequence constraints

It would be possible to formulate topology through sequence
constraints. However, sequence constraints have
a different use case -- they describe incomplete designs that may, for example,
be communicated to services for automated design or library construction. Standard sequence
editors will likely not support any sequence constraints framework in
the near future. By contrast, the current standard use case for SBOL is (or
should be) the communication of a complete sequence, e.g. for a plasmid
deposited at AddGene or a fragment described on parts.igem.org.

### 5.6 Application to non-DNA / RNA entities

Also protein or even small / medium-sized molecules can feature circular topologies and topology was originally envisioned to apply to all types of ComponentDefinition. However, in case of proteins, circularity is exceedingly rare and 'double-stranded' does not apply at all. Furthermore, the SO terms seem to be more or less explicitely defined for nucleic acid polymers. Explicitely excluding these fields from all non-RNA or DNA ComponenDefinitions therefore seems reasonable.
