Abstract
-----------

We propose to add a new class, `Implementation`, to allow users to represent physical realizations of biological designs. For example, an `Implementation` could be used to represent an aliquot of DNA, a cell clone, or a lysate. The `Implementation` class is meant to serve as a connection point between theoretical designs of biological systems and descriptions of their actual structure and/or function following their physical construction. In addition, an `Implementation` can eventually be linked to experimental data that characterize its performance or confirm its physical structure, etc.

Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>
----------------

* Provide an SBOL representation of biological instances of a design that can link to LIMS systems.

This SEP was initiated in response to the ["Design-Build-Test" thread] on sbol-dev.

Specification <a name="specification"></a>
----------------------------------------------

Here we define one new classes in the SBOL data model, `Implementation`.

### 2.1 Implementation <a name="impl"></a>

An `Implementation` represents a real, physical instance of a synthetic biological construct which may be associated with a laboratory sample. An `Implementation` describes the thing which was built during the Build phase of a D-B-T-L workflow. An `Implementation` may be linked back to its original design (either a `ModuleDefinition` or `ComponentDefinition`) using the `wasDerivedFrom` property inherited from the Identified superclass. An `Implementation` may also link to a `ModuleDefinition` or `ComponentDefinition` that specifies its realized structure and/or function as described in [Section2.1.1](#built).

#### 2.1.1 Implementation.built <a name="built"></a>

The `built` property is OPTIONAL and MAY contain a URI that MUST refer to a `TopLevel` object that is either a `ComponentDefinition` or `ModuleDefinition`. This `ComponentDefinition` or `ModuleDefinition` is intended to describe the actual physical structure and/or functional behavior of the `Implementation`. When the `built` property refers to a `ComponentDefinition` that is also linked to the `Implementation` via PROV-O properties such as `wasDerivedFrom`, it can be inferred that the actual structure and/or function of the `Implementation` matches its original design. When the `built` property refers to a different `ComponentDefinition`, it can be inferred that the `Implementation` has deviated from the original design. For example, the latter could be used to document when the DNA sequencing results for an assembled construct do not match the original target sequence.

Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>
-----------------

This proposal does not affect backwards compatibility.

Relation to Other SEPs <a name='competing_seps'></a>
-----------------

This proposal overlaps with the Implementation class presented in SEP 016, but adoption of SEP 017 does not preclude the future adoption of SEP 016.
